# automate-csv
Collection of python codes to automate the (mundane) task of editing coordinates stored in a csv before being uploaded unto a spatial database. (Work In Progress)

Problems to tackle/fix:
1. sorting the first column(name of point)
 

Things to add:
1. regex for other variations of 'REF' and 'CLO'
2. if the csvs are not all in one folder
3. gui(PyQt5) for non-python users
